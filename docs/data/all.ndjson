Purpose of Assessment\n This assessment was requested by the neighboring property owner and conducted to evaluate the potential risk posed\n by a mature tulip poplar tree located at the rear right corner of the property. The assessment was performed at the\n Level 2: Basic (Limited Visual) level following the ISA Tree Risk Assessment Qualification (TRAQ) methodology.\n 2. Site & Target\n Tree Location: Rear right corner of subject property, ?5 ft from property line.\n Primary Targets: Residence on subject property, neighboring residence, fence line, and yard use areas.\n Site Use: High-value residential setting with frequent occupancy and use.\n 3. Tree Condition & Observations\n Stem/Trunk:- Extensive vertical wound wood and decay column present along the main trunk, extending from the base upward.- Internal decay depth estimated between 12 inches and 2 feet.- Structural compromise with open cavities and exposed decayed wood.\n Crown/Canopy:- Significant dieback throughout canopy tips.- History of branch failure including recent limb breakage.- Major decay at 2/3 canopy height visible on main leader with central decay extending fully through the\n cross-section.\n Physiological Condition:- Stress response growth (epicormic sprouting) noted along trunk.- Reduced vigor and crown density.\n Recent Maintenance History:- Tree pruned within the past year for dieback removal.\n 4.

Along the upper main stem, a longitudinal split with associated canker tissue was observed. The wound has produced ram’s-horn-shaped wound wood, but closure remains incomplete, indicating limited compartmentalization of the defect. The co-dominant union contains included bark, increasing the likelihood of separation under wind or load stress. The upper crown section demonstrates a lateral bias over the house, with diminished foliage density and off-color needles relative to the opposing leader, suggesting partial canopy decline.","tree_number":"1","species":"Pine","coords":[-84.350544453235,33.862920553436]}

Tree exhibits significant canopy dieback and an excessively excurrent, columnar form indicative of prolonged suppression. Following adjacent canopy loss, this tree is unlikely to perform well as an open-grown specimen. Poor taper, poor structural development, and narrow crown form collectively reduce long?term stability.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:2Species:Sweetgum Tree Size (DBH):6Tree location:See site map Description of Tree:None Reason for Removal:OtherComments:Suppressed canopy with very poor form. The tree previously relied on adjacent vegetation for structural buffering and shared root plate stability. Now fully exposed, the slender form and insufficient taper make long?term performance unlikely. The tree lacks adequate structural development to withstand open-grown wind exposure.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:3Species:Sweetgum Tree Size (DBH):6Tree location:See site map Description of Tree:None Reason for Removal:OtherComments:One of two closely spaced Sweetgums, with only one stem measuring ?6 inches. Tree presents a single-leader crown with a visible breakout point where a lateral or lead previously failed. Decay is visible at the wound site. Form is poor, structure is narrow, and the tree is unlikely to adapt to increased exposure.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:4Species:Pecan Tree Size (DBH):28Tree location:See site map Description of Tree:None Reason for Removal:OtherComments:This tree possesses a pronounced lean over the right-of-way. The tree recently lost a major leader, resulting in a large rip-out with exposed wood. The leader's failure creates a structural imbalance, exposing the tree to accelerated decay. Lean direction, combined with biomass loss, significantly compromises future structural reliability.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:5Species:Sweetgum Tree Size (DBH):16Tree location:See site map Description of Tree:None Reason for Removal:OtherComments:This tree is exhibiting overall poor form. Multiple historical breakout points and regrowth indicate chronic structural instability. Primary union shows twisting and a weak formation; sloughed bark and possible woodpecker-type excavation suggest internal decay. A secondary leader shows evidence of prior breakage with a decay pocket located at a bending moment. The overall structure is unreliable and indicative of long-term decline and failure risk.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:6Species:Hardwood Tree Size (DBH):7Tree location:See site map Description of Tree:None Reason for Removal:OtherComments:Approximately 7-inch hardwood, likely Sweetgum, not shown on the survey. Size is estimated. Tree is completely overtaken by English ivy, obscuring visibility of trunk, root flare, and any potential defects. Degree of ivy coverage suggests long-term suppression and reduced vigor. Structural condition cannot be confirmed, but expected to be compromised.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:7Species:HW Tree Size (DBH):14Tree location:See site map Description of Tree:None Reason for Removal:OtherComments:14-inch hardwood (likely Poplar) with a mechanical wound on the main stem consistent with rubbing or impact from a fallen tree. Wounds include the loss of the sapwood layer, compromising structural fiber strength.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:8Species:Poplar Tree Size (DBH):32Tree location:See site map Description of Tree:None Reason for Removal:OtherComments:Multi-stem Poplar measuring 14 and 16 inches, with a third dead stem. Structure appears to originate from basal resprouting following prior removal. Basal resprouts inherently form weak, spreading unions with poor long-term reliability. The tree shows multiple breakout points and regrowth patterns.

The tree appears to have adapted reasonably well from a health standpoint, but structurally the situation remains questionable. The rooting environment is restricted, and the long-term construction history is unknown, making it difficult to determine how the root plate may have been altered. The tree is located approximately 9.5 feet from the house. While this does not qualify it under the five-foot rule, the proximity is still noteworthy given the asymmetric and unbalanced canopy that extends toward and over the house. The patio shows cracking near the root zone, which is not a concern raised by the owner but is noted as an observation reflecting the limited soil surface area within the retaining-wall/ patio enclosure. The tree has a co-dominant structure with included bark, consistent with past topping or a historic breakage event. Overall conditions reduce the tree’s suitability for long-term retention.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:2Species:Northern Red Oak Tree Size (DBH):21Tree location:See site map Description of Tree:Numbered flagging tape Reason for Removal:OtherComments:The tree has a noticeable pitch toward the dwelling and is growing directly at the base of the retaining wall. The rooting environment is restricted, and the structural root plate appears deformed from long-term contact with or accommodation around the wall. The crown is poorly developed, consisting mostly of epicormic shoots with little true crown architecture. The tree maintains a highly excurrent form with minimal lateral canopy development, suggesting chronic suppression. A nearby northern red oak is positioned in a more favorable growing location; if this tree and the adjacent tree (1) are removed, the remaining red oak would likely benefit from improved growing space and has potential to develop into a higher-quality canopy tree.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:3Species:AshTree Size (DBH):43Tree location:See site map Description of Tree:Numbered flagging tape Reason for Removal:OtherComments:The tree originated as a basal sprout and has undergone multiple topping events. These historic cuts and co-dominant unions have created significant bark inclusion throughout the upper structure, producing weak attachment points. An aerial graft is present in the upper canopy, adding further concern regarding load distribution and wind response. A significant historic wound is present at the mid-bole, forming a sunken area where a sweetgum sapling is growing. Its persistence during recent drought conditions suggests internal decay or moisture retention within the cavity. At the base, a pronounced bulge with roughly four feet of included material reflects a long-term structural fault. The combination of bark inclusion, topping history, irregular leader development, and internal moisture conditions substantially limits the tree’s structural integrity and long-term suitability for retention.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:4Species:Water Oak Tree Size (DBH):26Tree location:See site map Description of Tree:Numbered flagging tape Reason for Removal:OtherComments:The tree has a large historic topping wound partway up the main leader, with exposed interior wood and incomplete compartmentalization. Higher in the canopy, a second topping or breakage event is visible on the tension side of the remaining leader that extends over the house. The tree exhibits a noticeable forward pitch toward the dwelling, and the canopy shows a heavier, asymmetrical distribution in that direction. The slope beneath the tree drops away, offering limited lateral root anchoring and reducing stability. These combined structural defects, canopy imbalance, and topographic conditions reduce the tree’s long-term reliability.\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                         Parcel Information\n                                \n                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    \n\t\tParcel Number:17 01950003047 *Block:--Lot:--Subdivision:--","tree_number":"1","species":"Ash","coords":[-84.43568075688,33.827253390805]}

Defects are not correctable by pruning, and the tree presents an elevated risk of trunk failure.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:2Species:Tulip PoplarTree Size (DBH):28Tree location:back yardDescription of Tree:28\" Tulip Poplar that is also girdled by the zip line change Reason for Removal:Dying treeComments:28\" Tulip Poplar has been mechanically girdled by a fully embedded chain around the entire trunk circumference, causing vascular constriction, structural weakness, and likely internal decay. This defect creates a high likelihood of trunk failure at the constriction point. Condition is not correctable by pruning or support systems.\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                         Parcel Information\n                                \n                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    \n\t\tParcel Number:17 00610001060 *Block:--Lot:--Subdivision:--","tree_number":"1","species":"Tulip Poplar","coords":[-84.375622392448,33.844341452198]}

The remaining canopy shows asymmetrical loading and chronic structural imbalance.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:5Species:Magnolia Tree Size (DBH):13Tree location:See site map Description of Tree:Numbered flagging tape Reason for Removal:OtherComments:The tree exhibits a basal wound with exposed heartwood and developing decay. A ram’s-horn shaped wound at the trunk flare has not closed and continues to deteriorate. The canopy is asymmetrical and shows signs of chronic stress, suggesting reduced structural capacity.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:6Species:Sourwood Tree Size (DBH):7Tree location:See site map Description of Tree:Numbered flagging tape Reason for Removal:OtherComments:Tree is fully dead, with complete canopy decline and no visible live buds or live cambial tissue.

Significant ambrosia beetle frass is present at the trunk base and within multiple bark fissures, indicating sustained attack on dead wood. Combined with crown condition, the evidence confirms total tree failure.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:8Species:Sourwood Tree Size (DBH):7Tree location:See site map Description of Tree:Numbered flagging tape Reason for Removal:OtherComments:The trunk exhibits a pronounced dogleg bend with abnormal swelling at the bend point, suggesting internal weakness or decay. The geometry creates an elevated bending moment at the defect site. Further up the leader is a old branch site with decay extending to the main stem. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:9Species:Magnolia Tree Size (DBH):7Tree location:See site map Description of Tree:Numbered flagging tape Reason for Removal:OtherComments:A significant vertical cavity is present at the site of a former co-dominant union. The cavity exposes decayed inner wood and reveals incomplete compartmentalization around the failure site. This configuration leaves the tree structurally compromised with limited remaining cross-sectional strength.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:10Species:Post Oak Tree Size (DBH):16Tree location:See site map Description of Tree:Numbered flagging tape Reason for Removal:OtherComments:A large structural cavity exists where the main stem sweeps horizontally, located directly on the compression side of the bend. The exposed decayed heartwood at this point substantially weakens the load-bearing portion of the stem. The defect extends upward into the union, reducing structural integrity throughout the primary scaffold.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:11Species:Post Oak Tree Size (DBH):20Tree location:See site map Description of Tree:Numbered flagging tape Reason for Removal:OtherComments:The tree shows severe canopy thinning and limited live foliage concentrated only in the uppermost branches, indicating a very low live crown ratio. Basal irregularities and signs of long-term stress are present, and the overall canopy vigor suggests irreversible decline consistent with advanced physiological failure.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:12Species:Magnolia Tree Size (DBH):6Tree location:See site map Description of Tree:Numbered flagging tape Reason for Removal:OtherComments:The lower stem exhibits vertical bark loss and exposed cambial tissue consistent with deer antler rubbing. The wound is elongated and extends into the lower trunk, compromising the tree’s vascular continuity and increasing vulnerability to decay fungi.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:13Species:White Oak Tree Size (DBH):30Tree location:See site map Description of Tree:Numbered flagging tape Reason for Removal:OtherComments:Tree 13 has two basal cavities with interior hollowing, each with a different-sized opening. The tree also has a primary codominant union with included bark, likely formed after an older breakage or top-out event. Further up the trunk, a leader appears to have broken in the past, and a subordinate branch/leader has taken over, creating a twisted growth pattern with poor taper at a stair-step bend. The upper portion of the canopy leans toward the right-of-way. This tree also has a deformed structural root plate, similar to that of Tree 14.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:14Species:Winged Elm Tree Size (DBH):23Tree location:See site map Description of Tree:Numbered flagging tape Reason for Removal:OtherComments:This tree has a symmetrical codominant leader structure with included bark. One wound site shows evidence of an older breakage or top-out event, and a decayed leader remnant is visible at that location. This defect is notable because it lies just below the co-dominant union. The tree also shares a deformed structural root plate with Tree 13, as both trees are growing into each other at the base, reducing normal root plate development.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:15Species:Pine Tree Size (DBH):15Tree location:See site map Description of Tree:Numbered flagging tape Reason for Removal:OtherComments:The pine has a dead leader stub at the co-dominant union displaying exposed decayed heartwood. The decay extends into the union area, significantly weakening structural continuity between the main stems. Multiple branch failures and thin canopy distribution indicate declining vigor and compromised mechanical stability.\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                         Parcel Information\n                                \n                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    \n\t\tParcel Number:17 0234  LL030 *Block:--Lot:--Subdivision:--","tree_number":"1","species":"Pine","coords":[-84.454004121917,33.848000669389]}

While the upper crown appears seasonally normal, the root system, structural root plate, and critical root zone show long-standing impacts. On the west side, the structural root plate is impacted at approximately five feet, where it should be roughly eleven feet for a tree of this size, representing an estimated 20 to 25 percent SRP impact. Within that portion of the SRP and CRZ, multiple large structural and other roots are deteriorated and chronically damaged, with visible decay, past mechanical injury, and areas of erosion and root loss. The soil surface on the west side also shows evidence of historic compaction and wear consistent with regular vehicular or equipment use, which has further limited root development. The grade falls away from the tree on that side, and once the leaves were blown away, the total affected area was visually estimated at approximately 40 percent of the CRZ.
