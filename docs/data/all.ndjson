Purpose of Assessment\n This assessment was requested by the neighboring property owner and conducted to evaluate the potential risk posed\n by a mature tulip poplar tree located at the rear right corner of the property. The assessment was performed at the\n Level 2: Basic (Limited Visual) level following the ISA Tree Risk Assessment Qualification (TRAQ) methodology.\n 2. Site & Target\n Tree Location: Rear right corner of subject property, ?5 ft from property line.\n Primary Targets: Residence on subject property, neighboring residence, fence line, and yard use areas.\n Site Use: High-value residential setting with frequent occupancy and use.\n 3. Tree Condition & Observations\n Stem/Trunk:- Extensive vertical wound wood and decay column present along the main trunk, extending from the base upward.- Internal decay depth estimated between 12 inches and 2 feet.- Structural compromise with open cavities and exposed decayed wood.\n Crown/Canopy:- Significant dieback throughout canopy tips.- History of branch failure including recent limb breakage.- Major decay at 2/3 canopy height visible on main leader with central decay extending fully through the\n cross-section.\n Physiological Condition:- Stress response growth (epicormic sprouting) noted along trunk.- Reduced vigor and crown density.\n Recent Maintenance History:- Tree pruned within the past year for dieback removal.\n 4.

Along the upper main stem, a longitudinal split with associated canker tissue was observed. The wound has produced ram’s-horn-shaped wound wood, but closure remains incomplete, indicating limited compartmentalization of the defect. The co-dominant union contains included bark, increasing the likelihood of separation under wind or load stress. The upper crown section demonstrates a lateral bias over the house, with diminished foliage density and off-color needles relative to the opposing leader, suggesting partial canopy decline.","tree_number":"1","species":"Pine","coords":[-84.350544453235,33.862920553436]}
