        "tree_description": "None Reason for Removal:OtherComments:Note: All tree sizes were verified primarily from the survey due to limited access behind TPF fencing; field judgment applied as needed. Tree exhibits significant canopy dieback and an excessively excurrent, columnar form indicative of prolonged suppression. Following adjacent canopy loss, this tree is unlikely to perform well as an open-grown specimen. Poor taper, poor structural development, and narrow crown form collectively reduce long?term stability.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:2Species:Sweetgum Tree Size (DBH):6Tree location:See site map Description of Tree:None Reason for Removal:OtherComments:Suppressed canopy with very poor form. The tree previously relied on adjacent vegetation for structural buffering and shared root plate stability. Now fully exposed, the slender form and insufficient taper make long?term performance unlikely. The tree lacks adequate structural development to withstand open-grown wind exposure.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:3Species:Sweetgum Tree Size (DBH):6Tree location:See site map Description of Tree:None Reason for Removal:OtherComments:One of two closely spaced Sweetgums, with only one stem measuring ?6 inches. Tree presents a single-leader crown with a visible breakout point where a lateral or lead previously failed. Decay is visible at the wound site. Form is poor, structure is narrow, and the tree is unlikely to adapt to increased exposure.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:4Species:Pecan Tree Size (DBH):28Tree location:See site map Description of Tree:None Reason for Removal:OtherComments:This tree possesses a pronounced lean over the right-of-way. The tree recently lost a major leader, resulting in a large rip-out with exposed wood. The leader's failure creates a structural imbalance, exposing the tree to accelerated decay. Lean direction, combined with biomass loss, significantly compromises future structural reliability.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:5Species:Sweetgum Tree Size (DBH):16Tree location:See site map Description of Tree:None Reason for Removal:OtherComments:This tree is exhibiting overall poor form. Multiple historical breakout points and regrowth indicate chronic structural instability. Primary union shows twisting and a weak formation; sloughed bark and possible woodpecker-type excavation suggest internal decay. A secondary leader shows evidence of prior breakage with a decay pocket located at a bending moment. The overall structure is unreliable and indicative of long-term decline and failure risk.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:6Species:Hardwood Tree Size (DBH):7Tree location:See site map Description of Tree:None Reason for Removal:OtherComments:Approximately 7-inch hardwood, likely Sweetgum, not shown on the survey. Size is estimated. Tree is completely overtaken by English ivy, obscuring visibility of trunk, root flare, and any potential defects. Degree of ivy coverage suggests long-term suppression and reduced vigor. Structural condition cannot be confirmed, but expected to be compromised.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:7Species:HW Tree Size (DBH):14Tree location:See site map Description of Tree:None Reason for Removal:OtherComments:14-inch hardwood (likely Poplar) with a mechanical wound on the main stem consistent with rubbing or impact from a fallen tree. Wounds include the loss of the sapwood layer, compromising structural fiber strength.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:8Species:Poplar Tree Size (DBH):32Tree location:See site map Description of Tree:None Reason for Removal:OtherComments:Multi-stem Poplar measuring 14 and 16 inches, with a third dead stem. Structure appears to originate from basal resprouting following prior removal. Basal resprouts inherently form weak, spreading unions with poor long-term reliability. The tree shows multiple breakout points and regrowth patterns.

There is only foliage on the backside toward the neighbors. All the weight on one side. No way to trim for balance as we would have to remove 70% of the limbs.

        "tree_description": "Numbered flagging tape Reason for Removal:OtherComments:The tree is growing within a confined retaining-wall enclosure and, according to the owner, predates construction work performed on the site in the late 1980s. The tree appears to have adapted reasonably well from a health standpoint, but structurally the situation remains questionable. The rooting environment is restricted, and the long-term construction history is unknown, making it difficult to determine how the root plate may have been altered. The tree is located approximately 9.5 feet from the house. While this does not qualify it under the five-foot rule, the proximity is still noteworthy given the asymmetric and unbalanced canopy that extends toward and over the house. The patio shows cracking near the root zone, which is not a concern raised by the owner but is noted as an observation reflecting the limited soil surface area within the retaining-wall/ patio enclosure. The tree has a co-dominant structure with included bark, consistent with past topping or a historic breakage event. Overall conditions reduce the tree’s suitability for long-term retention.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:2Species:Northern Red Oak Tree Size (DBH):21Tree location:See site map Description of Tree:Numbered flagging tape Reason for Removal:OtherComments:The tree has a noticeable pitch toward the dwelling and is growing directly at the base of the retaining wall. The rooting environment is restricted, and the structural root plate appears deformed from long-term contact with or accommodation around the wall. The crown is poorly developed, consisting mostly of epicormic shoots with little true crown architecture. The tree maintains a highly excurrent form with minimal lateral canopy development, suggesting chronic suppression. A nearby northern red oak is positioned in a more favorable growing location; if this tree and the adjacent tree (1) are removed, the remaining red oak would likely benefit from improved growing space and has potential to develop into a higher-quality canopy tree.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:3Species:AshTree Size (DBH):43Tree location:See site map Description of Tree:Numbered flagging tape Reason for Removal:OtherComments:The tree originated as a basal sprout and has undergone multiple topping events. These historic cuts and co-dominant unions have created significant bark inclusion throughout the upper structure, producing weak attachment points. An aerial graft is present in the upper canopy, adding further concern regarding load distribution and wind response. A significant historic wound is present at the mid-bole, forming a sunken area where a sweetgum sapling is growing. Its persistence during recent drought conditions suggests internal decay or moisture retention within the cavity. At the base, a pronounced bulge with roughly four feet of included material reflects a long-term structural fault. The combination of bark inclusion, topping history, irregular leader development, and internal moisture conditions substantially limits the tree’s structural integrity and long-term suitability for retention.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:4Species:Water Oak Tree Size (DBH):26Tree location:See site map Description of Tree:Numbered flagging tape Reason for Removal:OtherComments:The tree has a large historic topping wound partway up the main leader, with exposed interior wood and incomplete compartmentalization. Higher in the canopy, a second topping or breakage event is visible on the tension side of the remaining leader that extends over the house. The tree exhibits a noticeable forward pitch toward the dwelling, and the canopy shows a heavier, asymmetrical distribution in that direction. The slope beneath the tree drops away, offering limited lateral root anchoring and reducing stability. These combined structural defects, canopy imbalance, and topographic conditions reduce the tree’s long-term reliability.\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                         Parcel Information\n                                \n                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    \n\t\tParcel Number:17 01950003047 *Block:--Lot:--Subdivision:--",

During this follow-up visit, after some seasonal leaf drop, clearer visibility into the crown was possible. While viewing the crown from the ground, an old scaffold limb on the main leader was observed to be fully decayed, and the bark immediately below the limb site is visibly sloughing from the main leader, indicating that decay has progressed into the primary leader stem.",
