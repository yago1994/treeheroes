The larger limbs pose a hazard to the car but also the people living who use this area frequently. The tree was examined by arborist who noted crown dieback and recommended removal of tree for safety. \n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                         Parcel Information\n                                \n                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    \n\t\tParcel Number:14 00470005013 *Block:--Lot:--Subdivision:--",

Primary scaffold limbs extend laterally with limited taper and minimal secondary branching, creating increased lever-arm stress. The tree is located within falling distance of the adjacent structure and paved use areas. Due to its height, narrow crown architecture, and limb orientation, any limb or upper-stem failure would result in direct impact to the structure or areas of regular pedestrian use.

The tree is growing in close competition with adjacent mature trees, resulting in reduced crown development and increased height-to-diameter ratio. This form increases susceptibility to windthrow and upper-stem failure. The tree is within falling distance of nearby structures and fencing, and failure would pose a safety hazard to property and occupants. Due to form, competition stress, and proximity, the tree meets DDH criteria as a hazardous tree.Reason for Removal:Dying treeComments:Tree #15 is a tall, slender hardwood with a narrow, suppressed crown and limited lateral branching.
