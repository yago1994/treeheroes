For the safety of students and staff, we request permission to remove the tree.Reason for Removal:Dead tree\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:2Species:Oak Tree Size (DBH):40Tree location:Love Hall Service Road Description of Tree:This mature oak has exhibited significant decline, evidenced by rapid browning and premature loss of foliage. The tree’s structural integrity appears compromised, increasing the risk of limb failure or total tree failure. Given its proximity—approximately 50 feet—to a playground that is actively used by students and faculty on a daily basis, the tree presents a notable safety hazard.

Historical imagery from 2010 shows a light-colored anomaly at the co-dominant union, consistent with a possible cavity or structural opening. In subsequent years, this area becomes obscured by vine growth, preventing conclusive visual verification during the current inspection.",
