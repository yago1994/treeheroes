        "tree_description": "Numbered flagging tapeReason for Removal:OtherComments:Canopy offset approximately 20 feet from the trunk, with the crown consisting primarily of two overextended leaders. A dead former co-dominant leader attachment site is present. Structural form suggests the tree was previously co-dominant, likely originating as a basal sprout, with one stem lost. The remaining structure exhibits imbalance and extended reach over the adjacent parking area, with targets present.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:2Species:PoplarTree Size (DBH):42Tree location:See site mapDescription of Tree:Numbered flagging tapeReason for Removal:OtherComments:Sharply co-dominant stems with approximately four feet of continuous bark inclusion. The overall structure suggests a basal sprout origin rather than two independently established trees. Canopy architecture indicates the tree has likely been topped at least twice, resulting in multiple sharply co-dominant unions at different heights. Upon post-inspection review, the subordinate trunk exhibits phototropic lateral growth toward the house and appears to be in close contact with, or rubbing against, a scaffold branch associated with one of the dominant leaders. Historic structural root plate disturbance is present in two locations. The tree is located close to the house, with targets present.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:3Species:Oak Tree Size (DBH):29Tree location:See site mapDescription of Tree:Numbered flagging tapeReason for Removal:OtherComments:Sharply co-dominant stems with approximately four feet of continuous bark inclusion.
