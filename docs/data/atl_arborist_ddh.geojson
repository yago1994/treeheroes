A dead former co-dominant leader attachment site is present. Structural form suggests the tree was previously co-dominant, likely originating as a basal sprout, with one stem lost. The remaining structure exhibits imbalance and extended reach over the adjacent parking area, with targets present.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:2Species:PoplarTree Size (DBH):42Tree location:See site mapDescription of Tree:Numbered flagging tapeReason for Removal:OtherComments:Sharply co-dominant stems with approximately four feet of continuous bark inclusion. The overall structure suggests a basal sprout origin rather than two independently established trees. Canopy architecture indicates the tree has likely been topped at least twice, resulting in multiple sharply co-dominant unions at different heights. Upon post-inspection review, the subordinate trunk exhibits phototropic lateral growth toward the house and appears to be in close contact with, or rubbing against, a scaffold branch associated with one of the dominant leaders. Historic structural root plate disturbance is present in two locations.
