The crown contains no live foliage, with complete needle browning and branch desiccation throughout the canopy. Structural integrity is compromised due to prolonged standing mortality, making the tree an elevated failure risk.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:2Species:Oak Tree Size (DBH):14Tree location:See site map Description of Tree:Numbered flagging tape Reason for Removal:OtherComments:This tree is dead, retaining leaves far beyond the normal abscission period and exhibiting no live buds. Ambrosia beetle frass is visible at the base, indicating colonization of dead or dying wood and confirming vascular system collapse. Bark is loose and sounding confirms internal decay. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:3Species:Magnolia Tree Size (DBH):15Tree location:See site map Description of Tree:Numbered flagging tape Reason for Removal:OtherComments:A prominent vertical decay column is present along the main stem, with exposed inner wood and bark separation indicating an active and advancing decay process. Structural stability is reduced as decay progresses upward within the trunk.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:4Species:White Oak Tree Size (DBH):21Tree location:See site map Description of Tree:Numbered flagging tape Reason for Removal:OtherComments:The tree has a co-dominant structure with a previously failed leader, leaving a major decayed stub with exposed heartwood. Compartmentalization around the wound is incomplete, leaving an open pathway for decay to extend downward into the parent stem and a critical union. The remaining canopy shows asymmetrical loading and chronic structural imbalance.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:5Species:Magnolia Tree Size (DBH):13Tree location:See site map Description of Tree:Numbered flagging tape Reason for Removal:OtherComments:The tree exhibits a basal wound with exposed heartwood and developing decay. A ram’s-horn shaped wound at the trunk flare has not closed and continues to deteriorate. The canopy is asymmetrical and shows signs of chronic stress, suggesting reduced structural capacity.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:6Species:Sourwood Tree Size (DBH):7Tree location:See site map Description of Tree:Numbered flagging tape Reason for Removal:OtherComments:Tree is fully dead, with complete canopy decline and no visible live buds or live cambial tissue. Branch structure is brittle and desiccated.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:7Species:Oak Tree Size (DBH):21Tree location:See site map Description of Tree:Numbered flagging tape Reason for Removal:OtherComments:The tree appears dead, retaining desiccated leaves and showing full canopy collapse. Significant ambrosia beetle frass is present at the trunk base and within multiple bark fissures, indicating sustained attack on dead wood. Combined with crown condition, the evidence confirms total tree failure.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:8Species:Sourwood Tree Size (DBH):7Tree location:See site map Description of Tree:Numbered flagging tape Reason for Removal:OtherComments:The trunk exhibits a pronounced dogleg bend with abnormal swelling at the bend point, suggesting internal weakness or decay. The geometry creates an elevated bending moment at the defect site. Further up the leader is a old branch site with decay extending to the main stem. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:9Species:Magnolia Tree Size (DBH):7Tree location:See site map Description of Tree:Numbered flagging tape Reason for Removal:OtherComments:A significant vertical cavity is present at the site of a former co-dominant union. The cavity exposes decayed inner wood and reveals incomplete compartmentalization around the failure site. This configuration leaves the tree structurally compromised with limited remaining cross-sectional strength.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:10Species:Post Oak Tree Size (DBH):16Tree location:See site map Description of Tree:Numbered flagging tape Reason for Removal:OtherComments:A large structural cavity exists where the main stem sweeps horizontally, located directly on the compression side of the bend. The exposed decayed heartwood at this point substantially weakens the load-bearing portion of the stem. The defect extends upward into the union, reducing structural integrity throughout the primary scaffold.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:11Species:Post Oak Tree Size (DBH):20Tree location:See site map Description of Tree:Numbered flagging tape Reason for Removal:OtherComments:The tree shows severe canopy thinning and limited live foliage concentrated only in the uppermost branches, indicating a very low live crown ratio. Basal irregularities and signs of long-term stress are present, and the overall canopy vigor suggests irreversible decline consistent with advanced physiological failure.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:12Species:Magnolia Tree Size (DBH):6Tree location:See site map Description of Tree:Numbered flagging tape Reason for Removal:OtherComments:The lower stem exhibits vertical bark loss and exposed cambial tissue consistent with deer antler rubbing. The wound is elongated and extends into the lower trunk, compromising the tree’s vascular continuity and increasing vulnerability to decay fungi.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:13Species:White Oak Tree Size (DBH):30Tree location:See site map Description of Tree:Numbered flagging tape Reason for Removal:OtherComments:Tree 13 has two basal cavities with interior hollowing, each with a different-sized opening. The tree also has a primary codominant union with included bark, likely formed after an older breakage or top-out event. Further up the trunk, a leader appears to have broken in the past, and a subordinate branch/leader has taken over, creating a twisted growth pattern with poor taper at a stair-step bend. The upper portion of the canopy leans toward the right-of-way. This tree also has a deformed structural root plate, similar to that of Tree 14.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:14Species:Winged Elm Tree Size (DBH):23Tree location:See site map Description of Tree:Numbered flagging tape Reason for Removal:OtherComments:This tree has a symmetrical codominant leader structure with included bark. One wound site shows evidence of an older breakage or top-out event, and a decayed leader remnant is visible at that location. This defect is notable because it lies just below the co-dominant union. The tree also shares a deformed structural root plate with Tree 13, as both trees are growing into each other at the base, reducing normal root plate development.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:15Species:Pine Tree Size (DBH):15Tree location:See site map Description of Tree:Numbered flagging tape Reason for Removal:OtherComments:The pine has a dead leader stub at the co-dominant union displaying exposed decayed heartwood. The decay extends into the union area, significantly weakening structural continuity between the main stems. Multiple branch failures and thin canopy distribution indicate declining vigor and compromised mechanical stability.\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                         Parcel Information\n                                \n                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    \n\t\tParcel Number:17 0234  LL030 *Block:--Lot:--Subdivision:--",

While the upper crown appears seasonally normal, the root system, structural root plate, and critical root zone show long-standing impacts. On the west side, the structural root plate is impacted at approximately five feet, where it should be roughly eleven feet for a tree of this size, representing an estimated 20 to 25 percent SRP impact. Within that portion of the SRP and CRZ, multiple large structural and other roots are deteriorated and chronically damaged, with visible decay, past mechanical injury, and areas of erosion and root loss. The soil surface on the west side also shows evidence of historic compaction and wear consistent with regular vehicular or equipment use, which has further limited root development. The grade falls away from the tree on that side, and once the leaves were blown away, the total affected area was visually estimated at approximately 40 percent of the CRZ. Although the canopy presents as typical for this species in dormancy, the existing SRP and CRZ damage materially reduces anchorage on the west side. These pre-existing conditions exceed the City of Atlanta's allowable SRP and CRZ impacts.",
