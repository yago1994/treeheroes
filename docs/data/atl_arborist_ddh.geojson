The tree exhibits signs of being dead or severely dying, including complete absence of foliage, extensive dead branching throughout the crown, and brittle skeletal structure with no signs of budding.Reason for Removal:OtherComments:The tree's massive size (25\" diameter), dangerous proximity to the home, and deteriorating condition create serious risk of catastrophic property damage and potential injury. In the event of tree or limb failure during storms or high winds, the tree would inevitably fall onto the house causing severe structural damage.\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                         Parcel Information\n                                \n                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    \n\t\tParcel Number:14 00480006013 *Block:--Lot:--Subdivision:--",
