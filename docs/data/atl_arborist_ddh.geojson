The prior Jarvis report (Sept 2022) noted heavy canopy loss and invasive vine coverage but did not reference the visible decay documented in its photographs. Current inspection confirms progressive decline, broken leaders, and visible decay at former branch attachments, indicating a chronic problem consistent with long-term decline.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:3Species:MulberryTree Size (DBH):15Tree location:See site map Description of Tree:Numbered flagging tapeReason for Removal:OtherComments:Previously approved under BA-202-20-5152 (Tree 3).

Because this area is actively used by children on a daily basis, the tree poses a safety risk due to the potential for dead or weakened limbs to fall. For the safety of students and staff, we request permission to remove the tree.Reason for Removal:Dead tree\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:2Species:Oak Tree Size (DBH):40Tree location:Love Hall Service Road Description of Tree:This mature oak has exhibited significant decline, evidenced by rapid browning and premature loss of foliage. The tree’s structural integrity appears compromised, increasing the risk of limb failure or total tree failure. Given its proximity—approximately 50 feet—to a playground that is actively used by students and faculty on a daily basis, the tree presents a notable safety hazard.
