        "tree_description": "None Reason for Removal:OtherComments:Note: All tree sizes were verified primarily from the survey due to limited access behind TPF fencing; field judgment applied as needed. Tree exhibits significant canopy dieback and an excessively excurrent, columnar form indicative of prolonged suppression. Following adjacent canopy loss, this tree is unlikely to perform well as an open-grown specimen. Poor taper, poor structural development, and narrow crown form collectively reduce long?term stability.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:2Species:Sweetgum Tree Size (DBH):6Tree location:See site map Description of Tree:None Reason for Removal:OtherComments:Suppressed canopy with very poor form. The tree previously relied on adjacent vegetation for structural buffering and shared root plate stability. Now fully exposed, the slender form and insufficient taper make long?term performance unlikely. The tree lacks adequate structural development to withstand open-grown wind exposure.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:3Species:Sweetgum Tree Size (DBH):6Tree location:See site map Description of Tree:None Reason for Removal:OtherComments:One of two closely spaced Sweetgums, with only one stem measuring ?6 inches. Tree presents a single-leader crown with a visible breakout point where a lateral or lead previously failed. Decay is visible at the wound site. Form is poor, structure is narrow, and the tree is unlikely to adapt to increased exposure.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:4Species:Pecan Tree Size (DBH):28Tree location:See site map Description of Tree:None Reason for Removal:OtherComments:This tree possesses a pronounced lean over the right-of-way. The tree recently lost a major leader, resulting in a large rip-out with exposed wood. The leader's failure creates a structural imbalance, exposing the tree to accelerated decay. Lean direction, combined with biomass loss, significantly compromises future structural reliability.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:5Species:Sweetgum Tree Size (DBH):16Tree location:See site map Description of Tree:None Reason for Removal:OtherComments:This tree is exhibiting overall poor form. Multiple historical breakout points and regrowth indicate chronic structural instability. Primary union shows twisting and a weak formation; sloughed bark and possible woodpecker-type excavation suggest internal decay. A secondary leader shows evidence of prior breakage with a decay pocket located at a bending moment. The overall structure is unreliable and indicative of long-term decline and failure risk.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:6Species:Hardwood Tree Size (DBH):7Tree location:See site map Description of Tree:None Reason for Removal:OtherComments:Approximately 7-inch hardwood, likely Sweetgum, not shown on the survey. Size is estimated. Tree is completely overtaken by English ivy, obscuring visibility of trunk, root flare, and any potential defects. Degree of ivy coverage suggests long-term suppression and reduced vigor. Structural condition cannot be confirmed, but expected to be compromised.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:7Species:HW Tree Size (DBH):14Tree location:See site map Description of Tree:None Reason for Removal:OtherComments:14-inch hardwood (likely Poplar) with a mechanical wound on the main stem consistent with rubbing or impact from a fallen tree. Wounds include the loss of the sapwood layer, compromising structural fiber strength.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:8Species:Poplar Tree Size (DBH):32Tree location:See site map Description of Tree:None Reason for Removal:OtherComments:Multi-stem Poplar measuring 14 and 16 inches, with a third dead stem. Structure appears to originate from basal resprouting following prior removal. Basal resprouts inherently form weak, spreading unions with poor long-term reliability. The tree shows multiple breakout points and regrowth patterns. Overall form and structure indicate weak union development and reduced longevity.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:9Species:Cherrylaurel Tree Size (DBH):6Tree location:Seesite map Description of Tree:None Reason for Removal:Invasive/undesirable treeComments:Undesired species. Approximate 6-inch Cherrylaurel basal sprout, likely originating from a previously removed tree. Size is approximate. Tree does not appear on the survey but is included for permitting clarity and accuracy. \n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                         Parcel Information\n                                \n                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    \n\t\tParcel Number:15 207 01 179 *Block:--Lot:--Subdivision:MSD-24-027/ 64 CLAY ST NE",

There is only foliage on the backside toward the neighbors. All the weight on one side. No way to trim for balance as we would have to remove 70% of the limbs. Leans toward the neighbor to the rear of the property and has dropped very large green and dead branches the last few seasons. I took a picture of a few spots with cavities. There is one hole on the trunk 10-12ft from the ground that's hard to photo.
