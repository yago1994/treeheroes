Based on visual confirmation in the field, both the standing tree and the detached leader are hackberry. The surrounding vegetation, including heavy invasive vine coverage, obscures the exact point of failure, but there is no plausible explanation other than structural failure originating from this tree. The fallen leader impacted and broke the fence, and the condition of the wood, orientation, and site evidence suggest that the failure likely occurred within the past 2-3 Months.",
