While probing the root collar area, I discovered a slightly hidden basal cavity and was able to insert a 3-foot rod freely, confirming an open void beneath the tree rather than within the main trunk. Sounding on the fluted area along the tension side, facing the fence, produced a hollow tone, indicating an underlying void beneath that section of the base.",
