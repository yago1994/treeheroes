For the safety of students and staff, we request permission to remove the tree.Reason for Removal:Dead tree\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTree number:2Species:Oak Tree Size (DBH):40Tree location:Love Hall Service Road Description of Tree:This mature oak has exhibited significant decline, evidenced by rapid browning and premature loss of foliage. The tree’s structural integrity appears compromised, increasing the risk of limb failure or total tree failure. Given its proximity—approximately 50 feet—to a playground that is actively used by students and faculty on a daily basis, the tree presents a notable safety hazard.
